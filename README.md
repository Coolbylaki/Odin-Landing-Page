# The Odin Project Landing Page

This is my first project in "The Odin Project" curriculum, orientated towards practicing pure css and flexbox. <br>
You can check it out by clicking on this [link!](https://coolbylaki.github.io/Odin-Landing-Page-Project1/)

Note: The project instructed me to not worry about responsive design or how will it look on different screens/devices because that will be covered in later topics.
